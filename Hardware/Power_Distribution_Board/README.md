Project created in KiCAD 8.0
PCB for distributing 12V and 5V power to other component
12 V XT60 Connectors for 8 ESCs, 2 for auxillary components
5V JST8 Connector
Parallel capacitance added on 12 V tether line to balance out tether inductance, reducing voltage spikes due to changes in current drad
TVS diode to protect if transient voltage spikes do occur as described above
